## Background

- Command Commissioning
- Building Optimization Group


## Reproducible Science

> "Scientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks
> to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way."


## Replication Crisis

- Ideas need to stand up to *repeated experimentation* by others.
- Engineering analysis (data and code) should be easily inspected and
  repeatable, but often isn't

## Industry

- Clients deserve to have access to:
    - data
    - analysis
    - results

- at any time
- *including the past*

## Reproducible Engineering

Built on two foundations:

1. Version Control

2. Build systems

-----

## Live Demo

- Start with baseline - no reproducibility steps taken
- Add version control
- Add build script
- Add build system(s)
- Containerize


## Version Control

- Git
- GitHub

## Build Systems

- `make`: Domain specific language
- `redo`: Shell or other interpreted language
- `doit`: Python
